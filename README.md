# 3D Structural Analysis of Human Hemoglobin

This project analyzes human hemoglobin structure using Python and py3Dmol. 
It includes:

- Chain lengths, RMSD analysis, and amino acid composition
- Interactive 3D model (`hemoglobin_3d.html`)
- Screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder
- Research report in PDF format (`report/hemoglobin_report.pdf`)

## How to view the 3D model
Open `hemoglobin_3d.html` in a web browser to interact with the 3D structure.
