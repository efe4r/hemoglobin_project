## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

This project focuses on the **computational analysis and 3D visualization of human hemoglobin** (PDB ID: `1A3N`). Hemoglobin is a vital protein responsible for oxygen transport in the bloodstream. Understanding its structure, amino acid composition, and inter-chain variations is critical in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biomedical research.

The project integrates **Python programming, structural bioinformatics, and interactive 3D molecular visualization** to provide a comprehensive analysis pipeline. It is designed to be reproducible, educational, and extendable for further computational biology studies.

## ðŸ§¬ Key Objectives

1. **Structural Analysis**: Determine the number of amino acids per chain and overall protein composition.
2. **Inter-chain Comparison**: Calculate structural differences between chains using **RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation)** based on C-alpha atoms.
3. **Amino Acid Categorization**: Classify residues into polar, nonpolar, and charged groups to assess biochemical properties.
4. **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Render an interactive 3D model of hemoglobin highlighting chains and functional heme groups using **py3Dmol**.
5. **Educational Insights**: Provide clear, reproducible outputs for learning structural bioinformatics and computational modeling techniques.
